### DSC 80: The Practice and Application of Data Science

### MATH 189: Exploratory Data Analysis and Inference

### DSC 106: Introduction to Data Visualization
[Visual Summary for Flights Within the U.S.](https://leffania.github.io/DSC106-Final/) <br>
By Justin Nguyen and Garrick Su

This repository includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to query and plot a variety of data visualizations based on flights data collected within the U.S. The result is a webpage with colored and interactive plots showcasing interesting insights about the data (e.g., frequency of cancelled or delayed flights by state).

### DSC 167: Fairness and Algorithmic Decision-Making
[An Analysis on Racial Discrimation in San Diego Police Stops](https://github.com/Leffania/DSC167-Paper-1) <br>
By Justin Nguyen

This repository includes both Python code and a LaTeX report as part of an interdisciplinary study (Data Science and the Social Sciences) treating police stops in San Diego as an algorithmic decision making system, evaluating whether or not it judges individuals of varying races fairly based on theoretical frameworks by political philosopher John Rawls.

### DSC 180AB: Data Science Project
[Performance Evaluation of Neural Networks on Community Detection](https://hblyx.github.io/CommunityDetection/) <br>
By Yaoxin Li, Justin Nguyen, and Vivek Rayalu

*(From the Abstract)*

This project investigates the performance of three machine learning approaches for community detection on two distinct datasets: the CORA academic citation network and a Twitch user dataset. The CORA dataset presents a challenging testbed for community detection algorithms, as it represents a citation network of scientific papers in computer science, while the Twitch Gamer dataset captures the two-sided friend relationships between Twitch users. Our first approach uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that considers only node features, while the second approach uses another MLP that only considers graph data. The third approach employs a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) that combines both node features and graph data. We evaluate the performance of these models on both datasets by comparing the results to the ground-truth labels provided by the authors of the datasets.
